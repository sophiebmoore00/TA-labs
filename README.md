# TA-labs
A repo of the labs I created as the Teaching Assistant of POLS 361, Data Analysis for Political Science

These labs are designed to teach political science students who have never even looked at R to learn the basics of programming in R and using R for data analysis with social science applications. I will be updating this repo during spring of 2021 as I make the labs.
